I"°<p>This is a <strong>blog</strong> and <strong>portfolio</strong> website.  All my guides and tutorials are available in the <a href="blog/"><strong>Blog</strong></a> part of the website, while everything else is pretty much about me.  Each subpage features a drawing from one of my favorite comic book artists, like Jean Giraud and Frazetta.  To navigate this website, use the <a href="#"><strong>menu at the top</strong></a>.</p>
