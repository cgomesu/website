(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/7phqk1/the_math_of_a_bruised_souleater/" target="_blank">This is a repost of my original reddit post here</a>. I've made a few changes to the original version to improve readability.)<br />
<br />
This is a post about an interesting interaction that came up 
yesterday, when I was making changes to an EDH deck.  I thought someone 
else might find this analysis interesting, so I decided to share it 
here. If you spot an error, feel free to point it out. The interaction is about two cards, namely <b>Immolating Souleater</b> and <b>Bruse Tarl, Boorish Herder</b>.<br />

<br />
Suppose you have Immolating Souleater on the battlefield and Bruse Tarl, Boorish Herder's triggered ability give it double-strike
 and lifelink. Souleater is a 1/1 creature that costs 2 colorless and let's you pay one 
phyrexian red mana to give it +1/+0 until eot.&nbsp; Let's assume you cannot 
pay red mana and if you want to activate Souleater's ability, you need 
to pay life.  The souleater is not under summoning sickness, so it can 
attack an opponent.  For now, let's also assume you have 40 life and 
your opponents also have 40 life.  You see an opportunity to kill an 
opponent, declare attack, the souleater is not blocked, you pay 38 life 
to make it a 20/1 creature with double-strike and lifelink, and after 
all damage is done, your opponent dies and you gain 40 life back (for a 
+2 net life, as you end up with 42 in the end).<br />
<br />
This is cool and all but what happens when you cannot pay 38 life 
before the first hit?  What if your opponent has more life than you?  
Life-wise, does it matter how much life you pay before the first hit?  
How much life can you pay at any given point to either maximize damage 
or minimize net life loss?  Let's think about it.<br />
<br />
Souleater's activated ability is a simple linear function of the 
amount of life you pay.  Let <i>x</i> be the amount of life paid, so that 
souleater's power is given by<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dhyLVHpLnmA/XTHcIETpmhI/AAAAAAAABQE/1ZexZS3jUU0UcTfjP_hABEKUfXvSVME_QCLcBGAs/s1600/eq1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="85" data-original-width="252" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dhyLVHpLnmA/XTHcIETpmhI/AAAAAAAABQE/1ZexZS3jUU0UcTfjP_hABEKUfXvSVME_QCLcBGAs/s1600/eq1.png" /></a></div>
(To make it simple, we 
ignore the fact that phyrexian mana is always 2 life and let <i>x</i> be any 
non-negative integer.)  As in the previous example, if you pay 38 life, 
f(38) = 20.  The tricky part is how this simple linear function 
interacts with Bruse's ability, that is, the ability to give a creature 
double-strike and lifelink ("bruised").<br />
<br />
The intuition with double-strike is to multiply <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) by 2, which 
would be correct if we only paid life before the first hit (<i>x1</i>) and 
nothing else before the second hit (<i>x2</i> = 0) but that does not need to be
 the case.  Say we pay 20 life before the first hit (<i>x1</i> = 20) and an 
additional 10 life afterwards (<i>x2</i> = 10).  How much damage will we deal 
to the opponent?  We know that <i>f</i>(20) = 11 and <i>f</i>(10) = 6 but the first 
hit should carry over to the second becasue the +1/+0 lasts until eot.  
At this point, let's make an equation for the first hit,<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z1yLtLX24OY/XTHcBOjC2KI/AAAAAAAABQA/HVGKRrMqP78TUTaPL_iU3YKiGIqFaRB9wCLcBGAs/s1600/eq2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="56" data-original-width="269" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z1yLtLX24OY/XTHcBOjC2KI/AAAAAAAABQA/HVGKRrMqP78TUTaPL_iU3YKiGIqFaRB9wCLcBGAs/s1600/eq2.png" /></a></div>
<br />
and another for the second hit,<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--iRYU1Z-mJo/XTHb9Eu15-I/AAAAAAAABP8/hFQYI9dP434sUqBY2b9qymaItdCx4JMfwCLcBGAs/s1600/eq3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="72" data-original-width="728" height="37" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--iRYU1Z-mJo/XTHb9Eu15-I/AAAAAAAABP8/hFQYI9dP434sUqBY2b9qymaItdCx4JMfwCLcBGAs/s400/eq3.png" width="400" /></a></div>
<br />
&nbsp;Now, we can sum both functions to get the total 
amount of damage dealt (<i>d</i>) by a Souleater with double-strike:<br />
<br />

<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2AlH-sOq3eY/XTHb5lsAczI/AAAAAAAABP0/q7kf9ig5JY4f_qcvpq-UZ8r0AQpn1PSgwCLcBGAs/s1600/eq4.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="77" data-original-width="1051" height="46" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2AlH-sOq3eY/XTHb5lsAczI/AAAAAAAABP0/q7kf9ig5JY4f_qcvpq-UZ8r0AQpn1PSgwCLcBGAs/s640/eq4.png" width="640" /></a> </div>
<br />
(It's easy to see how one could generalize 
this to triple-strike, quadruple-strike, ..., but let’s not delve into 
it now.)  Therefore, if <i>x1</i>=20 and <i>x2</i>=10, <i>d</i>(20,10) = <i>f1</i>(20)+<i>f2</i>(20,10), 
which is 27 damage for 30 life paid.<br />
<br />
So, now we have an equation (<i>d</i>) that we can play with. For 
example, if an opponent has 60 life, how much life do you need to pay?  
Because <i>x1</i> is multiplied by two, if the goal is to deal as much damage 
as possible, you should always pay as much life as possible before the 
first hit.  The easiest way here is to pay 58 life right away (<i>x1</i> = 58 
and <i>x2</i> = 0) but what if you only have 40 life.  Our dmg equation shows 
that if you have 40 life, you can pay 38 before the first hit (<i>x1</i>=38) 
but in order to kill your opp, you’d have to pay 40 before the second 
hit (<i>x2</i>=40), which we can already tell that won’t be possible with the 
other parameters we set for this scenario.  The question is then how 
high can x2 be in order to deal the highest amount of damage without 
killing ourselves?  Now we need to figure out how to add lifelink into 
the equation.<br />
<br />
Lifelink will affect your life total (<i>k</i>) and because a souleater with
 double-strike hits twice, let’s define your starting life total (<i>k1</i>), 
our life total after the first hit (<i>k2</i>), and our life total after the 
second hit (<i>k3</i>).  As before, let’s say that we pay 20 life before the 
first hit (<i>x1</i> = 20) and an additional 10 life afterwards (<i>x2</i> = 10).  
Because our life total matters here, let’s also assume that our starting
 life total is <i>k1</i> = 40.  So, if <i>x1</i> = 20, our remaining life before the 
first hit is the difference <i>k1</i> – <i>x1</i> = 20 and immediately after the first
 hit, the lifelink effect makes it go up by <i>f1</i>(20) = 11 points, which 
means that we can define<br />

and similarly,<br />

<br />
Now we have a simple way of defining net-life gain/loss (<i>nl</i>) as the 
difference between <i>k3</i> and <i>k1</i>, namely<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wB-v9hjyG84/XTHbkZJ-79I/AAAAAAAABPg/GhCI37Sar-8Z5DCqxBakzrdlgYU6KH8NACLcBGAs/s1600/eq7.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="76" data-original-width="373" height="65" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wB-v9hjyG84/XTHbkZJ-79I/AAAAAAAABPg/GhCI37Sar-8Z5DCqxBakzrdlgYU6KH8NACLcBGAs/s320/eq7.png" width="320" /></a></div>
<br />
which funny enough doesn’t include <i>x1</i> into the equation. The equation 
for nl tells us three main things: (a) that we will never net more than 2
 life, (b) we’ll net life loss proportional to the amount of life 
we pay before the second hit (<i>x2</i>), and (c) net-wise, it doesn’t really 
matter how much life you pay before the first hit (<i>x1</i>).  (<i>x1</i> doesn’t 
matter because in our scenario, it always nets 0 life.  Think about it. 
 You are paying 2 life to increase 1 dmg but with double-strike, 
souleater hits twice and in the end, you get your 2 life back with 
lifelink.  The only thing that carries over is the base power, which is 
why there’s a constant 2 in the equation for <i>k3</i>.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Good.  Now, what can we do with that?  Well, we can figure out how to
 maximize dmg in terms of our life total, so that you deal as much 
damage as possible without dying for any given amount of starting life 
total (the math equivalent of “just pay as much life as you can before 
each hit”).  For <i>k1</i> &gt; 0, let <i>i1</i> and <i>i2</i> be the
 amount of life you want to have before the first hit and second hit, 
respectively, then<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TmQSb93i_k0/XTHbdhU4O1I/AAAAAAAABPc/HlFtRFclXToZBqRfoMAcEp-Zsm1Fg6yMQCLcBGAs/s1600/eq8.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="60" data-original-width="1343" height="27" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TmQSb93i_k0/XTHbdhU4O1I/AAAAAAAABPc/HlFtRFclXToZBqRfoMAcEp-Zsm1Fg6yMQCLcBGAs/s640/eq8.png" width="640" /></a></div>
<br />
(There’s an additional complication here because of how we use phyrexian
 mana but we don’t need to worry too much about it as long as we can 
figure out the appropriate <i>i1</i> and <i>i2</i> for each value of <i>k1</i>.
  For example, if you have 40 life, max(<i>d</i>) = 2.5 + 1.25(40) - .75(2) -
 .5(2) = 50.  Because <i>k1</i> is multiplied by a value greater than one, this
 equation tells us that the amount of damage done above your starting 
life increases with our starting life.  For example, if you have 40 
life, you can deal 10 damage above your starting life to an opponent 
(e.g., kill an opponent with 50 life points) but if you have 20 life, 
you can only deal 5 damage above your starting life (e.g., kill an 
opponent with 25 life points).  It’s easier to see this relationship 
when we plot max(<i>d</i>) as a function of the starting life (<i>k1</i>) using the 
minimum appropriate values of <i>i1</i> and <i>i2</i>:<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
&nbsp;<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hhrmKTAKKeM/XTHQzX5EznI/AAAAAAAABPA/hG4vnqzyI4IqoF7_o_K-nwu2dKs87zjpwCLcBGAs/s1600/plot.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="587" data-original-width="750" height="250" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hhrmKTAKKeM/XTHQzX5EznI/AAAAAAAABPA/hG4vnqzyI4IqoF7_o_K-nwu2dKs87zjpwCLcBGAs/s320/plot.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<br />
If we fit a linear equation to it, we get a solution that does
 not require knowing the exact values of <i>i1</i> and <i>i2</i>, namely max(<i>d</i>) ≈ 
.65 + 1.25<i>k1</i>.&nbsp; However, because each point is equally likely, as /u/darth_aardvark pointed out, the appropriate intercept should be the mean of all possible combinations of min(<i>i1</i>) and min(<i>i2</i>), which can only take on values {1, 2}.&nbsp; There is a total of 2^2 combinations of&nbsp; min(<i>i1</i>) and min(<i>i2</i>), namely<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c2o6F9bHJ2w/XTIS0C8UVFI/AAAAAAAABQg/G2uYk4TQKbgrS2hxpM9zLhWKJFopuHjKQCLcBGAs/s1600/eq8-2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="237" data-original-width="736" height="128" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c2o6F9bHJ2w/XTIS0C8UVFI/AAAAAAAABQg/G2uYk4TQKbgrS2hxpM9zLhWKJFopuHjKQCLcBGAs/s400/eq8-2.png" width="400" /></a></div>
Those equations give us a mean intercept = .625 and a revised and final formula for the maximum amount of damage that a "bruised" souleater can do, specifically <br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZUFPOQUI09E/XTHa0rg9LFI/AAAAAAAABPU/aYoGCoDLvzUKAyj-rBccRJpd5pUt152UwCLcBGAs/s1600/eq9.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="73" data-original-width="337" height="69" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZUFPOQUI09E/XTHa0rg9LFI/AAAAAAAABPU/aYoGCoDLvzUKAyj-rBccRJpd5pUt152UwCLcBGAs/s320/eq9.png" width="320" /></a></div>
<br />
which is equivalent to the more memorable formula<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-01Bg4iZZAAE/XTIXoYSKvpI/AAAAAAAABQs/b7mIhtenEOMOwqKBzxS02gYHAwOh75pVQCLcBGAs/s1600/eq9-2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="110" data-original-width="523" height="67" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-01Bg4iZZAAE/XTIXoYSKvpI/AAAAAAAABQs/b7mIhtenEOMOwqKBzxS02gYHAwOh75pVQCLcBGAs/s320/eq9-2.png" width="320" /></a></div>
<br />
in which <i>k1</i> is simply your life total before the attack.&nbsp; The 5/4 coefficient is quite instructive because it connects this approach to /u/darth_aardvark's.&nbsp; Specifically, the first maximized damage of a bruised souleater will hit for approximately half our life total (<i>k1</i>/2), while the second hit will hit for half our life total plus half of the life gained from the second hit (<i>k1</i>/2 + <i>k1</i>/4), which gives us a total of 5/4*<i>k1</i>.<br />
<br />
Well, this has been fun.  I’m sure there are other things we could 
play with here but I’ve had enough for now.  I think there are two main 
conclusions about a “bruised” Souleater.  The first and least obvious 
one imo is that the more life you have, the more damage you can deal 
above your own life total.  This is useful because it gives an intuition
 about whether you can kill an opponent or not at any given point (low 
life = cannot deal much above my own life; high life = can deal a bit 
more than my own life), and whether you should attempt to compute 
exacties.  In most cases, however, you won’t be able to deal a whole lot
 more than your own life.  The other conclusion is that the amount of 
life you pay before the first hit and second hit is net neutral and net 
negative, respectively, but I feel most of us would be able to figure 
this one out without much effort (lifelink gets only half the amount of 
life paid immediately before the second hit, while it gets it all back 
for the amount of life paid immediately before the first hit).<br />
<br />
Again, if you spot an error, please point it out. If you found a 
better way to look at this interaction or thought about a different 
scenario, feel free to explain it.
