# Introduction
I have been playing [Magic: the Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com) (MtG) for as long as the game exists. If you have never heard about it before, MtG is a trading card game (TCG) created by [Richard Garfield](#) and released in 1993 by [Wizards of the Coast](#) (WotC). It is arguably the most successful TCG ever made and even though it was originally popularized as a paper format TCG, it has long been ported to digital formats. The main MtG client developed by WotC is called [MTG Online](#) (MTGO) and it requires users to buy digital versions of paper Magic cards to trade and play with other users on private servers. The development of such client has gone through many changes over the years but most of the details are unknown to the public because MTGO is not open source and a large portion of its functionality happens in the cloud. On top of that, MTGO only runs on Windows, leaving many of us nix users (e.g., GNU/Linux, macOS) without official support.

[![Card - FoW](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/card-fow.jpg){:.PostImage}](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/card-fow.jpg)

Fortunately, there are **free and open source software** (FOSS) alternatives to MTGO that **do not** require users to buy digital objects (cards) to play MtG. In this article, I talked about two of the main MtG rules engines (RE) currently available for offline and online play: **Forge** and **XMage**. More specifically, the article covers the main features of the Forge and XMage REs, how to install and use each one of them, and how you can contribute to maintain their development because these two projects are essentially community-driven. This is possible and completely legal because just like no company can claim ownership over the game of [poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker), WotC cannot claim ownership over the rules that constitute a game of MtG.

If you are interested in using and learning more about Forge and XMage, then keep on reading. As it is customary with my articles, I try to keep them up-to-date to reflect my current knowledge about the content, so if this is not your first time here, make sure to check the [Changelog](#changelog) for updates. Also, if you spot an error or disagree with something that I wrote or want to improve this article, feel free [to get in touch with me](/contact).

# MtG rules engines
The starting point of any game is a set of rules that tell us how the game is played. In most card games (e.g., [monte bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Bank)), this amounts to just a few basic rules that we can count on our fingers. In MtG, however, there are **over 250 pages of rules**, which are described in detail in the [MtG Comprehensive Rules book](https://magic.wizards.com/en/rules). As a player, you are not supposed to go over all such rules in order to play the game. In fact, most of us just learn the basics first (e.g., the concept of mana, card zones, casting, and win conditions), leaving the specifics to be learned as we play the game. Nonetheless, the sheer amount of specific rules in MtG does indicate that MtG is a complex game, and therefore, its digital implementation is non-trivial. This alone speaks volumes about the individuals who have taken for themselves the task of implementing the game, especially those who have done so without the support of a business, and the development of both Forge and XMage falls very much into such category.

Forge and XMage have in common the fact that they are both written in [**Java**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))--a mature and object oriented language--which makes them easily portable. In fact, contrary to MTGO, they run on pretty much any operating system. In addition, neither Forge nor XMage tries to simply emulate MTGO features; they actually introduce many **new features**. A major and common one is that both Forge and XMage allow users **to play against the computer (AI)**. In addition, because both applications are free to use, it is not necessary to make any financial investment to play MtG, whereas buying MTGO cards can sometimes feel more like buying stocks than playing a card game.

After that last point, I feel I should note that MTGO outshines any other MtG RE **by a huge margin** when it comes to **online play**. The community around it and the events are definitely unique and in my opinion, the strongest features of MTGO and I dare say, worth your money if you are into MtG.
{:.notice--warning}

However, even though Forge and XMage are both MtG REs, they are not mutually exclusive implementations of the game. Forge, on the one hand, has very unique play modes for single player, such as **Quests**, which are reminiscent of the old [Shandalar](#) MtG game by MicroPose. XMage, on the other hand, has a very reliable implementation of **online play**, which is quite unreliable in Forge. In other words, each RE has its strengths and weaknesses, which I summarized in the following table:

|Engine|Strengths|Weaknesses|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Forge | Various single player modes for **offline play** against the computer. Beautiful and customizable graphical interface. Runs on mobile (Android) as well as desktop. Supports card scripting. Supports almost every single card in MtG. | The AI will occasionally make very dumb plays--it's said that the AI works best with aggro strategies, as opposed to combos. Even though networking features exist for online play, it is quite unreliable. |
| XMage | Large community and arguably the most mature (unofficial) MtG RE available. Solid implementation for multiplayer, human vs. human, and **online play**. | Installation and usage can be challenging for unfamiliar and non-tech users. It does not support as many cards as Forge. |

For more comparisons, refer to the [Slightly Magic wiki list of MtG REs](https://www.slightlymagic.net/wiki/List_of_MTG_Engines).
{:.notice--info}

In brief, my opinion is that if you are looking for a single player experience, then try Forge. Now, if you want to play with friends online, then try XMage. Are you unsure? Try both! I think they are both great examples of FOSS applied to gaming and they complement each other in many aspects.  In any case, check the following sections for specifics about each of those MtG REs.

## Forge
Forge was originally written by a single individual ([mtgrares](https://mtgrares.blogspot.com/)) around the mid-2000s, then started being (`git`) versioned in 2011 by `jendave`. The project has since grown a lot and is currently maintained by a large number of [contributors and a group of core developers](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/graphs/contributors). It has been particularly active ever since 2017 and its repository is currently being hosted on Github ([Card-Forge/forge](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge)). Of note, Forge has both a **desktop release**, which is the main focus of this guide, and a mobile (Android) release, which is not covered in this guide but information about the installation of the `apk` is mentioned below.

[![Forge - GUI](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/forge-gui-01.png){:.PostImage .PostImage--large}](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/forge-gui-01.png)

As mentioned before, Forge features a very unique (*and hella fun!*) set of single player modes, namely **Quest mode**, **Puzzle mode**, and **Gauntlets**. The Quest mode plays like an RPG game in which you can improve your deck over battles against the computer. The Puzzle mode is pretty much self-explanatory: it gives you MtG puzzles to solve, such as how to win given a board state. Finally, the Gauntlets consist of a group of customizable players that play each other in a tournament-like fashion.

As it would be expected from an MtG RE, Forge also features a full blown **deck editor**. The editor lets users customize existing decks, build new ones, import from other applications, websites or `txt`, and also export decks created with Forge to other applications.

Interface-wise, Forge is actually my favorite MtG RE. Almost everything can be edited to the user's liking and they even have a **theme** selector feature. (`Magic` is my favorite one.)

### Gameplay demo

### Getting started
Forge requires a **Java Runtime Environment** (JRE) to run the desktop application and a screen resolution of at least **1024x768** (the bigger, the better). In my experience, the application can be a bit memory hungry at times but anything with at least **4GB of RAM** should be just fine.

For reference, the following table shows the versions of the software I used at the time of writing:

|application|version|
|:-:|:-:|
|`java`|`openjdk 11.0.15 2022-04-19`|
|`forge`|`1.6.53`|

For information about how to install JRE and Forge, take a look at the next section.

### Installation
- **Requirements**

  As before, Forge requires JRE to run, so [download and install Java on your machine](https://www.java.com/download/). If you are running GNU/Linux, you can check whether Java is already installed (and in your user's `$PATH`) via terminal, as follows:

  ```
  which java
  ```

  which should output the full path to your Java application. If it doesn't find anything, then you gonna have to install it.  In `apt`-based distributions, such as Debian and Ubuntu, you can install the OpenJDK JRE as follows:

  ```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install default-jre
  ```

  The Java Development Kit (JDK) itself is not necessary to run Java applications. You only need the JDK if you want to, say, compile java files into bytecodes that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is something you would do if contributing to the development and testing of a Java project. However, if you want to install the JDK as well as JRE, you can do so via `sudo apt install default-jre default-jdk`.
  {:.notice--info}

  If your distro does not use `apt` as package manager, just change the previous command to match whatever package manager you use. **Alternatively**, use the download link mentioned before to download Oracle JRE and follow the instructions mentioned there instead. (OpenJDK is also maintained by Oracle and in this sense, Oracle JRE and OpenJDK JRE are both official JREs.)
  {:.notice--warning}

  then check its version to make sure `java` is now reachable and is associated to the `apt` OpenJDK version we installed before:

  ```
  java --version
  ```
  ```
  openjdk 11.0.15 2022-04-19
  OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.15+10-post-Debian-1deb11u1)
  OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.15+10-post-Debian-1deb11u1, mixed mode, sharing)
  ```

  The `default-jre` package is often way behind the latest release but should be enough to run most Java applications. However, if you want to install the latest OpenJDK JRE package via `apt`, you will have to find what is available for your distribution and its repositories first.  For example, `sudo apt show openjdk-*-jre` should list all OpenJDK JREs available for you. At the time of writing, `openjdk-17-jre` is the latest OpenJDK JRE version available in Debian 11.
  {:.notice--warning}

- **Download and install Forge**

  Forge for desktop has **stable** and **snapshot** releases.  As the name suggests, snapshot are edge releases that contain the latest changes from source that have not been thoroughly tested, while stable releases contain changes that have been tested before. Most users should favor the **stable release** over snapshot. The stable desktop releases can be found at the following website:

  - [https://releases.cardforge.org/forge/forge-gui-desktop/](https://releases.cardforge.org/forge/forge-gui-desktop/)

  then look for the latest release version (e.g., `1.6.53`), which you can check by looking at the dates or comparing against the [tags in the official repository](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/tags), and download then the associated `.tar.bz2` (and optionally, its `.md5` hash to make sure the downloaded file matches the remote). Alternatively, you might want to try the following to download the latest Forge tarball and hash via terminal:

    - make sure `curl` and `jq` are installed:
      ```
      sudo apt install curl jq
      ```
    - move into this user's Downloads dir:
      ```
      cd ~/Downloads/
      ```
    - create a variable that stores de latest Forge version, according to the github repo:
      ```
      FORGE_LATEST=$(curl https://api.github.com/repos/Card-Forge/forge/tags | jq -r '.[0].name' | grep -oE "[[:digit:]]{1}\.+[[:digit:]]+\.+[[:digit:]]+")
      ```
    - download the latest Forge files from cardforge.org:
      ```
      curl -O "https://releases.cardforge.org/forge/forge-gui-desktop/$FORGE_LATEST/forge-gui-desktop-$FORGE_LATEST.tar.bz2"
      curl -O "https://releases.cardforge.org/forge/forge-gui-desktop/$FORGE_LATEST/forge-gui-desktop-$FORGE_LATEST.tar.bz2.md5"
      ```
    - after downloading the files, check hashes:
      ```
      echo "$(cat forge-gui-desktop-$FORGE_LATEST.tar.bz2.md5) forge-gui-desktop-$FORGE_LATEST.tar.bz2" | md5sum -c
      ```

  Once you have downloaded the tarball, extract it to a directory of your liking. Personally, I like to store such applications on a directory called `Applications` under my user's `$HOME` (e.g., `/home/cgomesu/Applications/`):

    - create an Applications dir for the current user if it doesn't exist:
      ```
      if [ ! -d "$HOME/Applications/" ]; then mkdir "$HOME/Applications"; fi
      cd "$HOME/Applications/"
      ```
    - extract the tarball into a subdir called forge-gui:
      ```
      mkdir forge-gui
      tar -xvf "$HOME/Downloads/forge-gui-desktop-$FORGE_LATEST.tar.bz2" -C ./forge-gui/
      ```

      If you have not declared and initialized a `FORGE_LATEST` variable before, then just edit the name of the tarball to match yours before running the command above.
      {:.notice--warning}

  Now move into the newly created `forge-gui` dir
  ```
  cd forge-gui/
  ```
  and at its root, you should find executables to start the application. For **GNU/Linux** and macOS users, there is a **shell script** called `forge.sh` that can be used to run Forge via the script's shebang:
  ```
  ./forge.sh
  ```
  or by calling `sh` directly:
  ```
  sh forge.sh
  ```
  This will start loading the Forge's graphical interface. If you run into issues, review your steps and then check the official [Forge Wiki](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/wiki) for alternative instructions.

- **Initial configuration**

  Now that Forge is up and running, go to **Game Settings**. I usually take this opportunity to configure my **Preferences** to automatically download missing art (Game Settings > Preferences > Graphic Options > Check 'Automatically Download Missing Card Art'), which prompts Forge to download card art on demand. Afterwards, head to **Content Downloaders** and at the very least, go ahead and download the following items:

  - Quest images
  - Achievement images
  - Card prices
  - Skins

  The other options will take a long time to complete, so I usually prefer to let the on-demand option we checked before to handle missing art.

  Now, if you don't feel like opening a terminal every time you want to run Forge, I strongly suggest you to create a custom **launcher** for it. In GNU/Linux, the specifics of how to create a launcher depends a lot on the distribution and more specifically, the desktop environment you are using (e.g., XFCE, GNOME, KDE). Here's how my current launcher configuration looks like:

  [![Forge - XFCE launcher](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/forge-xfce-launcher.png){:.PostImage .PostImage--large}](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/forge-xfce-launcher.png)

  My desktop environment of choice for Debian is [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/) and the maintainers have already documented [how to create custom launchers](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/launcher), so I won't cover such details here.
  {:.notice--info}

  If you change location of your current Forge desktop application, you can simply edit the desktop launcher to point to the new directory under which the `forge.sh` helper script is located.

### Card scripting
In `res/cardsfolder/`, you will find a compressed directory containing a `txt` file for each MtG card supported by the Forge RE. Those files are **card scripts** that tell Forge how each card works via parameters for the various properties, effects, and abilities that each card might have. Take, for example, the card **Fyndhorn Elves**:

[![Card - Fyndhorn Elves](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/card-elves.jpg){:.PostImage}](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/card-elves.jpg)

and its script (`res/cardsfolder/f/fyndhorn_elves`):

```
Name:Fyndhorn Elves
ManaCost:G
Types:Creature Elf Druid
PT:1/1
A:AB$ Mana | Cost$ T | Produced$ G | SpellDescription$ Add {G}.
Oracle:{T}: Add {G}.
```

As you can see, the card script is not written in Java or any other high level language and for the most part, its structure and parameters are quite intuitive, which means that anyone can help writing card scripts for upcoming sets, even if you are not a developer yourself. Of course, some cards can be more complex than others. Take a look, for example, at **Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer**:

[![Card - Ragavan](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/card-ragavan.jpg){:.PostImage}](/assets/posts/2022-07-18-forge-mtg/card-ragavan.jpg)

```
Name:Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer

SVar:DBCleanup:DB$ Cleanup | ClearRemembered$ True
K:Dash:1 R
Oracle:Whenever Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer deals combat damage to a player, create a Treasure token and exile the top card of that player's library. Until end of turn, you may cast that card.\nDash {1}{R} (You may cast this spell for its dash cost. If you do, it gains haste, and it's returned from the battlefield to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.)
```

However, you can write scripts for whatever you feel comfortable with, for just a single card from an upcoming set or a bunch of them. The specifics of the so-called **card API** can be found at the [Forge Wiki - Card Scripting API](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/wiki/Card-scripting-API). To learn about which cards have not been scripted yet, check the [Projects](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/projects), which should list a few (upcoming) sets and the status of each card.

Writing card scripts for the Forge RE project is a great way to contribute and if you want to get involved, check the [Contributing](#contributing) section of this article to learn more about versioning (`git`) and setting up your project dir.  However, before submitting a pull-request (PR) for a new card script, make sure to check the project's current workflow for such contributions. As a general rule of thumb, go over the project's wiki (or `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide) and if you cannot find any info about it, then **ask one the maintainers** to explain how you can help with such a task.

At the time of writing, for example, there seems to be an open issue for each upcoming card that has not been scripted yet (e.g., [issue#974](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/issues/974) for the card [Windshaper Planetar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windshaper%20Planetar) from the *Commander's Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* set) and a successful PR is one that fixes this issue by merging a commit to the repo's `master` branch that contains the new card script(s) (e.g., [PR#994](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/pull/994)).
{:.notice--info}

### Android APK
Forge is very unique in which it also **runs on Android**, so you can install it on your mobile or tablet running **Android 9** or newer. The Android interface has its own peculiarities--because the application is designed for mobile--but if you are familiar with the desktop version, you will get the hang of the mobile version very quickly.

Older versions of the Forge MtG RE for Android exist that run on older versions of Android. This is an alternative if you are not running a modern Android OS but of course, such versions of the RE do not have cards from the latest sets, functionalities that were implemented recently, and so on. If that is okay, then when selecting the Forge version in the instructions below, just try older ones until you find one that works with your device and Android version.
{:.notice--info}

{% include video id="NyjU1KN1Rv4" provider="youtube" %}

As far as I'm aware, the Forge `apk` (Android package) is not distributed via any well known app store (e.g., Google's Play Store, F-Droid), so you will need to download and install it from the official website.  In addition, the app requires *storage permission* in order to function, so once we have installed it, we need to manually add such permission for it to work. If that sounds good and you want to give it a try, then follow these steps:

1. Grab your Android device.
2. We need to allow our Internet Browser (and possibly, File Manager) to install apps from **unknown sources**. By default, such options is disabled. To enable it, go to **Settings** and search for 'unknown source', then follow the options to allow your Internet browser of choice (e.g., DuckDuckGo, Chrome) to install apps from unknown sources.
3. Navigate to the cardforge.org website (see below) to **download the latest Forge apk**. First, you need to find the latest Forge version available (e.g., `1.6.53`). Then, find the corresponding directory that ends with three additional numbers (`1.6.53.001`) and enter in whichever one is the highest for the last Forge version (`004`). Inside such subdirectory, there should be an `apk` file that you should download and then install.
   - [https://releases.cardforge.org/forge/forge-gui-android/](https://releases.cardforge.org/forge/forge-gui-android/)
4. After downloading, open the `apk` and follow instructions to **install the Forge package**. When done, close the install window.
5. Search for the Forge app icon in your home screen or app list. Then go into its **App info** > Permissions and allow it access to *Files and media* (or *Storage*, depending on which Android version you are running).
6. Now, open the Forge app and follow instructions to download the assets (images, sounds, etc.) and when done, it should ask you to restart the application.
7. That is it!  Enjoy Forge on your mobile.
