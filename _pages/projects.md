  - title: "ESP-01 ambient sensor"
    excerpt: "The project describes the assembly of a cheap (less than USD$6), low-power (less than 1W), and low-profile (less than 5cm long) environmental sensor based on the ESP-01 WiFi module and the BME280. The unit runs a free and open source firmware (Tasmota) and provides temperature, humidity, and relative pressure measurements to home automation systems via the MQTT messaging protocol."

  - title: "ESP32-cam"
    excerpt: "The ESP32 is a low-cost and low-power microcontroller developed by Espressif. This project describes how to flash the Tasmota32 webcam server (beta) firmware onto the ESP32-cam module with onboard Wi-Fi. The Tasmota32 firmware can be used as an alternative to the Espressif CamWebServer Arduino sketch for users looking for more options to monitor and control an ESP32-cam remotely or to integrate into an existing home automation server via HTTP requests or MQTT."

  - title: "A ch√°cara microserver"
    excerpt: "The microserver is composed of an HP Proliant Microserver Gen8 running Openmediavault and a Dell Optiplex 3060 micro running Proxmox. Both machines are used mostly for security-related things (surveillance cameras, location tracking) and Plex and Plex-related programs (PMS, Tautulli, Sonarr, Radarr, etc.). Other uses have to do with a universal desktop folder (Syncthing) and data analysis (R server)."

    excerpt: "This is a CLI diagnostic tool for audio files written in GNU Bash that extends my previous bash-flac-diag tool to mp3 and other audio formats. In brief, it tests a single or multiple audio files and generates logs with good files (no errors found) and bad ones (at least one error found). Tests are performed by codec-specific tools. There are two post-processing modes for bad files: fix or delete."

  - title: "Multi-trial data count"
    excerpt: "A VBA macro for MS Excel that counts patterns of correct responses (C) and errors (E) across multiple trials (e.g., CCC, CCE, CEC, ..., EEE). It was initially developed as a tool to help with the data analysis of multi-trial memory experiments in which subjects provide boolean-type responses (yes/no, correct/error) for multiple items across multiple tests. In such designs, each item generates a pattern of C-E responses across tests. This VBA macro counts all such patterns across subjects and items."
