# Application knowledge
This is a list of applications that I'm familiar with.  They're order alphabetically and organized by area. 
## Network
### SSH
#### [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)
> OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol. It encrypts all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. In addition, OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure tunneling capabilities, several authentication methods, and sophisticated configuration options. 

#### [Putty](https://putty.org/)
> PuTTY is an SSH and telnet client, developed originally by Simon Tatham for the Windows platform. PuTTY is open source software that is available with source code and is developed and supported by a group of volunteers.

### VPN
#### [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/)
> OpenVPN Connect is the free and full-featured VPN Client that is developed in-house. It is the official Client for all our VPN solutions. Any other OpenVPN protocol compatible Server will work with it too.

### Firewall
#### [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/)
> pfSense is an open source firewall/router computer software distribution based on FreeBSD. It is installed on a physical computer or a virtual machine to make a dedicated firewall/router for a network. It can be configured and upgraded through a web-based interface, and requires no knowledge of the underlying FreeBSD system to manage.

In addition to the basic configuration, I'm familiar with the following pfSense packages:

##### [HAproxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)
> HAProxy is free, open source software that provides a high availability load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications that spreads requests across multiple servers. It is written in C and has a reputation for being fast and efficient.

##### [Snort IPS/IDS system](https://www.snort.org/)
> Snort is a free open source network intrusion detection system and intrusion prevention system created in 1998 by Martin Roesch, founder and former CTO of Sourcefire. Snort is now developed by Cisco, which purchased Sourcefire in 2013.

##### [pfBlockerNG](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/packages/pfblocker.html)
> pfBlocker-NG introduces an Enhanced Alias Table Feature to pfSense software.
> 
> What it allows:
>    Assigning many IP address URL lists from sites like I-blocklist to a single alias and then choose a rule action.
>    Blocking countries and IP ranges.
>    Replacement of both Countryblock and IPblocklist by providing the same functionality, and more, in one package.
>    Uses native functions of pfSense software instead of file hacks and table manipulation.

### SD-WAN
#### [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/)
> ZeroTier provides open-source software, SDKs and commercial products and services to create and manage virtual software defined networks.

### Sync
#### [Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)
> rsync is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and an external hard drive and across networked computers by comparing the modification times and sizes of files. It is commonly found on Unix-like operating systems. Rsync is written in C as a single threaded application.

#### [Rclone](https://rclone.org/)
> Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage. It is a feature rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage interfaces. Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage services, as well as standard transfer protocols.

#### [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
> Syncthing is a free, open-source peer-to-peer file synchronization application available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, Solaris, Darwin, and BSD. It can sync files between devices on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet. Data security and data safety are built into the design of the software.

### NAS

#### [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com/)
> Tautulli is a 3rd party application that you can run alongside your Plex Media Server to monitor activity and track various statistics. Most importantly, these statistics include what has been watched, who watched it, when and where they watched it, and how it was watched. The only thing missing is "why they watched it", but who am I to question your 42 plays of Frozen. All statistics are presented in a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to brag about your server to everyone else.

### Servers
#### [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
> Jellyfin is the volunteer-built media solution that puts you in control of your media. Stream to any device from your own server, with no strings attached.
