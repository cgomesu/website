# Programming Skills
A list of various languages that I've used before, listed in order of highest to lowest familiarity.

## Backend languages

| language | skills |
|:---:|:---:|
| [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) | My preferred language for backend development.  I'm very familiar with it and thus feel comfortable writing entire new projects from scratch or working with someone else's code.  I'm particularly familiar with data manipulation packages, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html), but have worked with requests, regex, itertools, and other multi-purpose packages as well. |
| [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) | Used for data processing and statistical analysis. Of note, I'm particularly familiar with the multilevel/hierarchical/mixed-effects package [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) and the multinomial modeling packages [MPTinR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MPTinR/index.html) and [TreeBUGS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TreeBUGS/index.html). |
| [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) | Familiar with the main aspects of the language (e.g., create tables, adding/editing entries, various methods of fetching data, keys) as well as the more advanced and dynamic aspects (e.g., setting up triggers, special constraints, functions). |
| [SPSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS) | Able to read and write customized syntax, particularly anything related to generalized linear models. |
| [VBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications) | My first contact with coding was writing macros for MS Excel back in early 2000s.  From there, I delved a bit deeper into proper VBA but honestly, I have a superficial understanding of it. I can read and write it just fine though. |
| [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) | Standard CLI stuff.  Nothing too fancy, so I wouldn't say I'm very familiar with it. |
| [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) | Only basic knowledge about the syntax and use cases.  I've used before and getting more familiar with it as I learn about Laravel (see [frameworks](#frameworks)). |
| [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) | Helped parsing a few neuroimaging datasets during my Ph.D..  I'm not very familiar with the language but can read it. |

## Frontend languages

| language | skills |
|:---:|:---:|
| [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) | Very familiar with it.  Used to design (very crude) websites when I was a teenager and started getting back into web development in the more recent years. |
| [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) | Very familiar with it but have never done anything too fancy. |
| [MD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) | Got into it when I started using Github and has become one of my favorite ways of writing rich text nowadays. |
| [JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) | Only basic knowledge about the syntax for frontend use cases. |

## Frameworks

| framework | skills |
|:---:|:---:|
| [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) | A PHP framework that I started learning when I decided to learn more about PHP. I've very little experience with it. |

## Static website generators

| generator | skills |
|:---:|:---:|
| [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) | A static site generator that I got into when I started learning about Github Pages.  This website was built with Jekyll. |

# Stats Skills

| analysis | note |

| [Multi-level ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model) | Also known as random coefficient modeling and hierarchical modeling. For continuous or discrete variables. |
| [Regression ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) | Linear regression, logistic (or any other family) regression, one or multiple predictors. |

# Application Knowledge
This is a non-exhaustive list of applications that I'm familiar with.  (Of course, that's in addition to applications commonly used to edit text, to browse files and the web, to edit images, spreadsheets, and so on.)  They're ordered alphabetically and organized by area. 
## Containers and virtualization
### [Docker (CE)](https://www.docker.com/)

## Data analysis
### GPT, multiTree, HMMTree
A collection of applications for the analysis of multinomial processing tree (MPT) models.  I'm listing here just for historical purposes.  R packages provide a much more conveninent way of working with datasets and MPT models.

### [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)
> Just another Gibbs sampler is a program for simulation from Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov chain Monte Carlo, developed by Martyn Plummer. JAGS has been employed for statistical work in many fields, for example ecology, management, and genetics.
